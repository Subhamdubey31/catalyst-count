# Catalyst Count

A Django web application for uploading, filtering, and counting large datasets.

## Project Overview

This project enables users to:

Securely log in to the application
Upload large CSV files (up to 1GB) with visual progress indication
Filter the uploaded data using a user-friendly form
View the count of records based on applied filters

## Technologies Used

Django 3.x/4.x
SQLITE
Bootstrap 4/5
django-environ
django-allauth

Step 1: Create a new project using Django called catalyst-count
Step 2: Set up the project with SQLite database
Step 3: Configure repo on Bitbucket or GitHub and maintain project on the repo using git
Step 4: Configure and secure environment variables using django-environ
Step 5: Configure authentication via django-all-auth
Step 6: Download the test data set
Step 7: Create UI using Bootstrap 4 with JS
Step 8: Understand & program the features for the pages

#Note
All features work properly, but when my CSV file reaches 99%, an automatic alert shows 'invalid file.' I tried to solve this but couldn't.
